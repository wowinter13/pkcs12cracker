# pkcs12cracker

This crate is a simple tool to concurrently attack a password-protected PKCS#12 (PFX/P12) file. Its main goal is to be faster, more efficient, and more reliable than existing tools written in Go and C.

#### High-Level Overview [TODO]

By default, all CPUs of the machine are utilized.

(Provide a high-level overview of the project.)

#### Tasks to Complete:
- Add Clippy.
- Set up CI (tests, coverage, code quality checks, etc.).
- Spend time on license comparison.

#### Major TODOs:
- Implement pattern functionality (e.g., `--pattern=abc?d`).
- Add custom charset functionality (e.g., `--charset=ěščřžýáíůä`), which requires thorough testing.
- Create a Homebrew release.
- Benchmark memory, CPU, time, and operations per second.
- Explore advanced multithreading techniques:
  1. Remove `par_split()` and `par_iter()`.
  2. Consider scoped threads.
  3. Explore a custom raw threading approach.
